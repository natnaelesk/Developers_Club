# 🧠 Python Mini Challenges – Level 1  
**AUWC Developers Club**  
**Hey Developers!**  
I’ve prepared some Python practice questions—from easy to a little challenging. Try them out and share your solutions or struggles in the group. Let’s level up together! 🚀

---

### 🔹 1. Even or Odd  
**What to do:**  
Ask the user for a number. Tell them if it’s even or odd.

**Example:**  
- Input: `4` → Output: `"4 is Even"`  
- Input: `9` → Output: `"9 is Odd"`

**Why it matters:**  
You’ll practice conditions and the `%` operator. Simple but foundational—this is how computers start thinking logically.

### 🔹 2. Maximum of Three Numbers  
**What to do:**  
Ask the user to enter **three numbers**, and print the **largest**.

**Example:**  
- Input: `3, 10, 7` → Output: `"10 is the largest number"`

**Why it matters:**  
A great way to practice comparisons and condition chaining. You'll build cleaner logic with each attempt.

### 🔹 3. Prime Number Checker  
**What to do:**  
Ask the user to enter a number. Tell them whether it’s a **prime number** or not.

**Example:**  
- Input: `7` → Output: `"7 is a Prime Number"`  
- Input: `12` → Output: `"12 is Not a Prime Number"`

**Why it matters:**  
You’ll build your first proper algorithm using loops and conditions. Trust us—this one’s a classic for a reason.

### 🔹 4. FizzBuzz  
**What to do:**  
Print numbers from **1 to 100**. But:
- If divisible by 3 → print `"Fizz"`  
- If divisible by 5 → print `"Buzz"`  
- If divisible by both → print `"FizzBuzz"`

**Example Output:**  
```
1  
2  
Fizz  
4  
Buzz  
Fizz  
7  
...  
14  
FizzBuzz
```

**Why it matters:**  
A popular interview question. Sharpens your logic, condition handling, and code structure.

### 🔹 5. Remove Duplicates  
**What to do:**  
Ask the user for a list of numbers (e.g. `1 2 2 3 3 4`). Remove duplicates and print only the unique ones.

**Example:**  
- Input: `1 2 2 3 4 4 5`  
- Output: `1 2 3 4 5`

**Why it matters:**  
You’ll practice list handling, iteration, and maybe even `sets`. Think like a data cleaner 🧼

### ✅ Have Fun!  
Pick a challenge and go for it.  
If it works — awesome. If it doesn't — no stress. Share what happened in the group, and let’s fix it together.

Let’s code, break stuff, and learn. 🧑🏾‍💻🔥
